# GB-DP
The source code for A fast granular-ball-based density peaks clustering algorithm for large scale data published on IEEE TNNLS
The algorithm is implemented in Python, which is GB-DP.py. After constructing the decision graph, please manually select centers in the plot.
We also upload some synthetic datasets. Please note that drawing the clustering results may take a little longer time.
